# dataintegritypolicy
To strengthen data governance and compliance, I led the development and implementation of a **Data Integrity Policy** to ensure accuracy, consistency, and security across enterprise data. Collaborating with IT, security teams, and business units, I established **access controls, validation mechanisms, audit logging, and change management procedures**, aligning with frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001. This initiative improved risk mitigation, enhanced regulatory compliance, and ensured reliable data for decision-making, while regular audits and monitoring reinforced ongoing adherence to data integrity standards.
